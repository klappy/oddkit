Instruction sync routing tests
===============================

Test 1: instruction_sync missing both baseline_root and registry_payload => FAIL
PASS: missing baseline_root/registry_payload errors
      Expected error pattern: must provide either baseline_root or registry_payload

Test 2: instruction_sync with both baseline_root and registry_payload => FAIL
PASS: baseline_root XOR registry_payload enforced
      Expected error pattern: cannot provide both baseline_root and registry_payload

Test 3: Non-sync action without message => FAIL
PASS: message required for non-sync actions
      Expected error pattern: message is required

Test 4: instruction_sync payload mode with empty registry => SUCCESS
PASS: payload mode executes

Test 5: state_payload without registry_payload => FAIL
PASS: state_payload requires registry_payload
      Expected error pattern: state_payload requires registry_payload

===============================
All instruction_sync routing tests passed!
