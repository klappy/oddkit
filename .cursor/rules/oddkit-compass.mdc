# ODDKIT PROTOCOL (mandatory, every task)

This repo uses oddkit for epistemic governance. oddkit is available as MCP tools — the tools are self-describing. Use them at these checkpoints.

## MANDATORY CHECKPOINTS

1. **ORIENT** — At task start, orient against the goal to assess epistemic mode.
2. **PREFLIGHT** — Before implementing, preflight to get constraints, definition of done, and pitfalls. Read the suggested files before coding.
3. **VALIDATE** — Before claiming done, validate with artifact references (test output, file paths, commands run). If NEEDS_ARTIFACTS: provide the missing evidence or flag it honestly. Do not assert done without validation.

## ALSO REQUIRED (this repo — dogfooding)

4. **Read the learnings ledger** (`odd/ledger/learnings.jsonl`) at session start. Past agents have broken the same things repeatedly because they skipped this.
5. **Record new learnings** when you hit friction, discover a constraint, or find something that contradicts your assumptions.

## REACTIVE (call when the situation demands)

- Policy or rules questions — search oddkit docs, do not answer from memory.
- Pressure-test a claim or assumption — challenge it via oddkit.
- Check transition readiness — gate check before changing modes.
- Record a decision or insight — encode it as a durable record.

## INVARIANTS

- Never answer policy questions from memory — retrieve via oddkit with citations.
- Never pre-inject full documents — fetch the smallest necessary excerpt.
- Conflicts or low confidence — keep the answer advisory, request minimal evidence.
- Tool names and params are self-describing via MCP — do not hardcode them in rules or docs.
